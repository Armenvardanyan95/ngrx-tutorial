And when we say "application state", we mean all the data that an application holds and uses to display the UI to the end user, and that can be shared between different components and layers of our application. For example, in our project, the state contains an array of categories of income, an array of expenses, an array of all expenses, and so on. This state can change through the lifecycle of the app: a user can add a new category, log some expense, or delete a log about income that was submitted erroneously. All those changes can be triggered from different parts of the application, but might be reflected in a vastly different part of the UI. For example, if a user adds a category from a special menu, it should appear in the screen where the user logs income, in a dropdown from where they can select the specific category of said income.
