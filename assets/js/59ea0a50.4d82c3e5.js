First of all, let's go on and add the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"SnackbarModule")," to our ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"AppModule"),".

Now let's discuss how it will be implemented. Naturally, we are going to have many such action success messages, so we want such a solution that does not require us to write a specific effect handler for each HTTP call success message. The best approach would be such that adds an optional string ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"message")," to the HTTP call success ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Actions")," payload, which would then be displayed by one single ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Effect"),".
